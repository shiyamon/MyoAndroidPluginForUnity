# MyoAndroidPluginForUnity
Myo plugin for Unity Android.
This plugin enables you to build Android application in a simillar way with the method describe in http://grimpixelstudios.com/getting-the-myo-armband-to-work-with-unity-on-android/

Currently, wrapped methods are very limited. You can get Myo orientation, pose, and connect/disconnect.
C# implementation inside Unity sample is way ugly, in order to keep compatibility with original Mac SDK.

Tested with:  
Android Studio 2.1.3  
myo-android-sdk-0.10.0  
Unity 5.3.6f1
